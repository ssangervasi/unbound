## Make up the controls as you play
![Simple Level](about/about-simple-level.png)

Start each level with no keys bound.

Step on "binders" to gain a sense of direction â€” until you run out of memory. 

## Find your way out 
![Dark Level](about/about-dark.png)

These disembodied voices are hiding something from you...

The exit. Also their private thoughts and feelings. But mostly the exit. 


## Test your logic and your memory
