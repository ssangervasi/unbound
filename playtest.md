 - Windows

fullscreen option alignment
✅ screen flash on opening
quick through the tutorial
using mouse to chart a course
✅ **tempted to click reset indicator**
  - having to hold escape is bad
  - maybe could fade in even later
~ 3:11pm
first thinker was F part 3
  ~ 5 tries
misdirected by up arrow towards hidden spot
LOL at back n forth narration
"do i have to collect all the binders?"

~3:28pm
Big B
Big C
  - "this is like a tutorial level"
  - "the brain is like a 'clear'"

~3:37pm
First discovered a hidden area
  - the symmetrical level
  - shocked
  - didn't go for it
3-path level was a real teaser
  - crunched on it then nailed it

~3:41pm
C3
  - needed reset
~3:48
Level Threedom

~3:50pm
When first key was removed, it didn't really matter because she had switched layouts anyway

4pm
Darkness
  - seemed to do the trick in terms of initial analysis paralysis
  - did go for the sneak through the darkness plan

Clearer intsructions
 - do you need all binders
 - are the secrets traps

4:05
Ended after Dudle 


## Bugs
double music glitch?
 - if the loop would enqueue at the same time as the previous track ended?
 - zombie track
clicks not working on pause screen
 - something to do with touch device vs mouse?
✅ second level pause doesn't work
✅ crowded square wrong tiles for start & exit
✅ memory lapse narration happens on retry
character movement after crossing exit looks weird
✅ cursor appears at start of scene

## Mechanic ideas
one-time floors, or floors you can't cross more than X times

mac

initial unclear what fogetting meant, but figured out after a couple key presses
"it seems like I can only use two keys"
"does the right arrow at the top mean i have to right"

6:20pm
First level with hidden collectable

"dammit I can't remember"

Crowded square
  - "i have no idea what i'm doing now"
  - still only took 2 tries
Big A seemed too easy compared to Crowded Square

6:28pm
Memory lapse
 - "oh i choose the one to forget"
 - "oh i don't need it" for the extra down
 
More of a figure-it-out-while-moving style of play


6:35 pm
Three path is a thinker

"does that mean i get more memory"

6:40pm
Past three bindings

Some difficulty with the memory game, turned on bind hints
 - "really helps"

6:47-54
Many tries on Cells

Worried about remembering bindings, but mostly succeeding anyway

6:59
Mystery Island
 - "what is that down there"

7:02
Dudle
 - hidden binder was tricky
 - mind blown by second switch

7:07
Collected binder

7:12
Four things!

7:14-
7:22-
Big maze is harder
Stuck

Final feedback
 - Could use more specific first description
 - Lapse, light, were intuitive
 

## Mech ideas
change the color of the text for the key that is forgotten

## Bugs
Music skipping
 - after changing options
 - on level reset?
Cursor not hiding
Apple app window title is "index.html"
Inconsistent mouse on pause menu
I don't think indicators should  be hidden behind darkness
Binder Z- index on first dark binder
Sounds on the "go faster" when nothing is typed
  - And that narration replays
