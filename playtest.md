 - Windows

fullscreen option alignment
✅ screen flash on opening
quick through th etutorial
using mouse to chart a course
✅ **tempted to click reset indicator**
  - having to hold escape is bad
  - maybe could fade in even later
~ 3:11pm
first thinker was F part 3
  ~ 5 tries
misdirected by up arrow towards hidden spot
LOL at back n forth narration
"do i have to collect all the binders?"

~3:28pm
Big B
Big C
  - "this is like a tutorial level"
  - "the brain is like a 'clear'"

~3:37pm
First discovered a hidden area
  - the symmetrical level
  - shocked
  - didn't go for it
3-path level was a real teaser
  - crunched on it then nailed it

~3:41pm
C3
  - needed reset
~3:48
Level Threedom

~3:50pm
When first key was removed, it didn't really matter because she had switched layouts anyway

4pm
Darkness
  - seemed to do the trick in terms of initial analysis paralysis
  - did go for the sneak through the darkness plan

Clearer intsructions
 - do you need all binders
 - are the secrets traps
 - 


## Bugs
double music glitch?
 - if the loop would enqueue at the same time as the previous track ended?
 - zombie track
clicks not working on pause screen
 - something to do with touch device vs mouse?
second level pause doesn't work
crowded square wrong tiles for start & exit
memory lapse narration happens on retry
character movement after crossing exit looks weird
✅ cursor appears at start of scene

## Mechanic ideas
one-time floors, or floors you can't cross more than X times
