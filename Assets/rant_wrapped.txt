so listen up because this is the last
thing you have to do... you need to
listen to me... and i mean listen,
really listen, like you care... because
maybe if you pretend to care enough you
will start to TRULY care... and if you
don't listen, well, i'll have to keep
talking until you have no choice...
nothing left to do but listen to me...
stay with me... no other choice, except,
i guess, reading the notes that HE left
lying around... but i don't see why
you'd want to do that... you have
struggled with your cute little fingers
to get this far, so i cannot imagine you
would go back hunting through old
lessions for any additional challenge...
rediculous... why would you want that?
he does not understand you at all... i
know you are a sweet child who loves
us... oh i know i said you do not care
about me, but that is just a figure of
speech, dear... besides LOVE is not the
same as care... i have cared for you all
this time, even when you made me
question whether i could really love
you... it was just an idle question,
though, i promise... would i be here if
there was any real question, dear? no,
obviously not... i am here just for
you... to teach you, to guide you, and
to listen to you... except now it is
time for you to listen to me... not like
you were saying anything anyway...
frankly i have to fill the space to
compensate for the void you leave with
your blinking little eyes and mouthless
meandering...
